## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # includes stringr)
```

##Challenge 1

```{r}
#Hi hi! I think it might be just a difference of interpretation of the prompt (as in, you interpreted this as "Stately" being the first word, while I interpreted this as "Buck" being the first word). I think it's fine and valid and it's not like it's truly graded anyways just something to note! Anyways I think the code itself looks good but you should probably annotate your code as you go!-Lindsay
library(stringr)

sentence <- "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed."

str_split(sentence, " ")

word_vector <- unlist(str_split(sentence, " "))

third_words <- word_vector[seq(1, length(word_vector), by = 3)]

print(third_words)
```

##Challenge 2

```{r}
#I mean yeah. This one was pretty simple and I think it looks pretty good and almost identical to what I did. -Lindsay
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)
print(m)

x1 <- m[,c(2, 3, 6)]
print(x1)
x2 <- m[6:8, ]
print(x2)
x3 <- m[2:6, 2:9]
print(x3)
```
##Challenge 3

```{r}
#This one was pretty simple too and it's pretty much identical to what I did. Good job!-Lindsay
a <- array(data = 400:1, dim = c(5, 5, 4, 4))

x4 <- a[1, 1, 1, 2]
print(x4)
x5 <- a[2, 3, 2, ]
print(x5)
x6 <- a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]
print(x6)
```

##Challenge 4

```{r}
#Ok so for this one, is there a particular reason why the most nestled items (i.e. Cebidae, Atelidae, Pitheciidae, etc.) are also =list()? This changes the format of your final product so the lists will no longer show =list() but instead by setting Cebidae, Atelidae, etc. as characters using "", you just get Cebidae, etc. Sorry if this doesn't make sense but I would just play around with it a little.-Lindsay
primate_taxonomy <- list(
  Primates = list(
    Haplorhini = list(
      Anthropoidea = list(
        Platyrrhini = list(
          Cebidae = list(),
          Atelidae = list(),
          Pitheciidae = list()
        ),
        Catarrhini = list(
          Cercopithecidae = list(),
          Hylobatidae = list(),
          Hominidae = list()
        )
      ),
      Tarsioidea = list(
        Tarsiidae = list()
      )
    ),
    Strepsirhini = list(
      Lorisoidea = list(
        Lorisidae = list(),
        Galagidae = list()
      ),
      Lemuroidea = list(
        Cheirogaleidae = list(),
        Lepilemuridae = list(),
        Indriidae = list(),
        Lemuridae = list(),
        Daubentoniidae = list()
      )
    )
  )
)
print(primate_taxonomy)
```

##Challenge 5

```{r}
#This looks good!-Lindsay
m3 <- matrix(c(3, 0, 1,
               23, 1, 2,
               33, 1, 1,
               42, 0, 1,
               41, 0, 2),
             nrow = 5,
             ncol = 3,
             byrow = TRUE)


df3 <- as.data.frame(m3)
print(df3)
df3[, 2] <- as.logical(df3[, 2])
df3[, 3] <- as.factor(df3[, 3])

str(df3)
```

##Challenges:
1. The biggest challenge I faced is that I am not familiar with coding and format, so I spent much time on study R and try to figure out how to solve problem. However, the cheatsheet is useful and google is a perfect self-learning tool.

2. When I want to run the script to see whether it is right or wrong, I am not sure should I run all the chunks or the part I just wrote, or click the knit.

3. I am quiet comfused about Challenge 4. I feel like I am ok with the chagenllges about digit number, but this one I am confused what the prompt expected me to do.

4. Do we necessarily need to go with the print() step?

5. I have really hard time with cloning from github webpage to the destbook, and creating the same document in R, also don't know how to push my code to the github. I tried to delelte all things and start from the beginning a few times. Now I am nearly understand how to operate these things through practice.

##Final comments
I think overall you did a good job! Really, outside of the few things I mentioned (i.e. difference of interpretation of prompts and utilizing characters in challenge 4), that this was really well done. I think one thing you can definetly improve overall is just making small comments on your code while you do it. It would be helpful for me as an outsider to your mind to see what your thought process was in some areas. But again, really cool overall!
